## **Hello**

As a freelance software developer some of the qualities that describe me best are my creative problem solving skills, the ability to think outside of the box, and a quick and eager learner of programming languages and frameworks. My peers have often described me as a communication oriented and proactive colleague whose opinion they strongly value.

A proud achievement of mine is the 'e-orders' ordering system which I developed. It uses the Flask web Framework as a back-end along with React Native for the mobile app, serving the local hospitality businesses in my home town.
