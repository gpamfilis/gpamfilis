## **Hello I'm George**

As a freelance software developer, some of the qualities that describe me best are my creative problem-solving skills, the ability to think outside of the box, and being a quick and eager learner of programming languages and frameworks. My peers have often described me as a communication-oriented and proactive colleague whose opinion they strongly value.

A proud achievement of mine is the 'e-orders' ordering system that I developed. It uses the Flask web Framework as a back-end along with React Native for the mobile app, serving the local hospitality businesses in my hometown.
